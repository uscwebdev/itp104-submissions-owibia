            <h2>Directions:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, stir together the slightly warm
                    water, instant yeast, honey, extra virgin olive oil and
                    fine sea salt until evenly combined. Tip your bread
                    flour into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients and
                    mix with a spoon until all dry flour patches have
                    disappeared. Place cloth over top of bowl, let rest for
                    10 minutes at room temperature.</li>
                <li>After 10 minutes, you will perform a stretch + fold. This
                    helps to develop the gluten in the dough which will
                    help with the structure of the bread. Wet your hand
                    (this prevents dough from sticking to you), grab a
                    handful of dough from the 12 o'clock position, pull it
                    up slightly and then pull it all the way up and over the
                    bulk of the dough to the 6 o'clock position. Repeat
                    this action on all sides of the dough until it feels like
                    you've created a bit tension and you can't stretch the
                    dough up and over anymore...it should have tightened
                    up into a rough ball. Let rest for
                    10 minutes and then repeat the stretch + fold action
                    one more time.</li>
                <li>After the second set of stretch and folds, wet your
                    hands, gather your dough and place it seam side
                    down into bowl so the top is quite smooth (this helps
                    prevent air bubbles from escaping).</li>
                <li>Top the dough with a good drizzle of olive oil (1 Tbsp)
                    and rub it over the dough to make sure entire top
                    surface has been covered. Cover your bowl with a
                    reusable shower cap, a lid, plastic wrap, or transfer
                    into a Tupperware container. The dough will rise in the
                    fridge during its rest, so make sure there is room in the
                    bowl for growth. Put in coldest spot of your fridge and
                    let rest for 24 - 48 hours. <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); display: inline;">I personally do about 36 hours</div></li>
                <li>Prepare your 9" x 13" (22cm x 33cm) baking tray. Put a
                    tiny bit of oil on the tray, rub it all around and then
                    place a sheet of parchment paper on top and press
                    down. The oil helps the parchment to stick in place.
                    Then drizzle about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil on the
                    parchment paper and spread it evenly around the
                    base and sides of the paper lining the tray/pan. The
                    parchment prevents the focaccia from sticking to the
                    tray when baking.</li>
                <li>Remove your dough from fridge and using a curved
                    dough scraper, gently release the dough from the
                    sides of the bowl and tip the dough into your oiled
                    and lined tray.</li>
                <li>Now, you are going to oil your hands and fold one
                    side of dough towards the middle of the blob of
                    dough. Repeat with the other side, a bit like folding a
                    piece of paper into thirds. Then flip the dough so the
                    seams from the folding are at the bottom and the
                    smooth side is at the top.</li>
                <li>Cover using another tray, inverted - this prevents the
                    dough from drying out and forming a crust while it
                    rises. If you don't have another tray, a plastic storage
                    box can work too. Do not cover the dough with plastic
                    wrap or a tea towel, it will stick.</li>
                <li>Let sit for about 1.5 - 2.5 hours (the dough should be
                    mostly filling the space in the tray). If it's not filling the
                    space after this period of time, oil your hands and
                    from the underside of the dough you gently pull it
                    towards the edges of the tray. The timing will depend
                    on the temperature on the day. If it's a very hot day it
                    might only take 1.5 hours to puff up/spread in tray. On
                    a very cold day it could take 2.5 hours.</li>
                <li>Once you think the dough is ready (it will be floofy
                    and jiggly when you shake the tray), it's time to
                    preheat your oven to 220C/430F.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the top of the dough with a little more extra
                    virgin olive oil and then oil your hands. Using both
                    hands, press your fingers into the dough, gently
                    touching the bottom of the tray. Repeat until the entire
                    tray of dough is dimpled. There is such a thing as too
                    much dimpling though.you can lose some of the nice
                    bubbles you've created in the dough if you dimple too
                    much. Just be mindful of air pockets and try not to
                    pop themâ€¦these bubbles are what make the crumb ol
                    a focaccia so interesting and delicious.</li>
                <li>Top with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt. Add anything
                    you'd like to the top by gently pressing toppings int
                    the little dimples: olives, rosemary (coat in a bit of olive oil
                    so it doesn't burn), cherry tomatoes, onions, jalapel
                    + cheese. Before dimpling, you could top with basil
                    pesto or with my chimichurri sauce if using oily
                    toppings like these, then omit the drizzle of olive oil</li>
                <li>I always bake my focaccia for about 18-22 minutes in
                    a 220C/430F oven. Bake on the lowest rack in the
                    oven to crisp the bottom of focaccia and prevent the top 
                    from burning. If you have a pizza setting in your oven, use that;
                    Check the focaccia after 18-20 minutes and
                    remove from oven when it's reached a deep golden
                    brown colour. If your top is not browning, broil on high for 3-5 
                    minutes, checking frequently.</li>
                <li>Let cool for a few minutes in the pan before transfering to a 
                    wire rack to cool for at least 15-20 minutes. Serve with a balsamic
                    vinegar and olive oil dip if desired.</li>
