        <h1>Final Project Summary | Olivia Dien | ITP104</h1>

        <h2>Topic:</h2>
        <p>The topic of my project is an online cookbook.</p>
        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>The purpose of my project is to create a cookbook 
            of my favorite recipes that I can easily share with others. 
            One of the reasons I am so passionate about cooking is the
            universal joy it can bring to others whether they are the chef
            or the consumer.</p>
        <h2>Extras:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I have a submission page where users can submit new recipe ideas/revisions.</li>
            <li>I have included transformations on <a href="recipe.html">the recipe page</a>
                to scale up the recipe descriptions when hovered on.</li>
            <li>I used the JavaScript plugin <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/animation/fade-in-scroll-load.html">Fade-In-Scroll</a> 
                on <a href="front_page.html">the front page.</a></li>
        </ol>
